# ai00i
He will know what it is for.


## Instructions

1. I made a quick CLI to help, to use it you need to make it executable:
```
chmod +x ai00i
```

2. (Developers only) install the developer requirements into your virtualenv or workspace:
```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

3. (Optional) if you want to learn about the wonderful pre-commit, which helps you to code with precision...
```
pre-commit install
```
... will install the hooks so that as you commit your code, it gets tidied up systematically for you.

4. Run the CLI to train the model.
```
./ai00i train
```
