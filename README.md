Perform a classification/regression using a Random Forest:
- We predict a target traffic intensity level in a unit location at a specific time interval. 
- We adopt the following types of features: 
  1) time features, such as hour, day-of-week, and week; 
  2) spatial features, such as location_id; 
  3) rain (precipitation); 
  4) Context such as holidays, sporting events, construction, etc.
